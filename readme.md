## **Overview of the Website** ##
This is a single page website, which is a link previewer. Link Previewer means that when you will provide the link of a website then it will extract the title, description and it's logo image and will show you that.

As we have seen in the Whatsapp or Facebook that when we paste a link it shows us a pop up box which contains some of the basic details about that link, that's a link previewer.

We just have to paste or type the url of the website and hit the search button, the website will automatically fetch the data using an API and will display those data over the webpage.

This is a fully responsive website which means you will have a good experience while viewing this it in any of your device.
